# Tic-Tac-Toe
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. 
It allows two players to take turns marking the cells in a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". 
The goal is to achieve three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
